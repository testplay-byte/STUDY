# WORKLOG — Study Helper Planner (repo-side master log)

> Append-only. Every agent appends the same section to this file AND to the local
> shared log (`/home/z/my-project/worklog.md`). Newest sections at the bottom.

Task ID: 0
Agent: coordinator (Z.ai main)
Task: Phase 0 recon + Phase 1 system setup (repo skeleton, conventions, pipeline tooling)

Work Log:
- Unzipped M-0 (7p), M-1 (36p), S-0 (9p), S-1 (10p) = 62 JPG pages (~2300×3200)
- Visual recon: identified both books; M-1 = Unit 01 "Functions and Graphs" (printed page = image + 6); S-1 = Chapter 8 "Set Theory" of Basic Statistics Part-II (printed page = image). User brief's "Statistics ch. 1–2" is actually Ch. 8 — flagged in PLAN.md
- Initialized repo `main`, wrote README, docs/PLAN.md, docs/CONVENTIONS.md, docs/prompts/vlm-image-to-markdown.md, tools/prompt.txt (master VLM prompt), tools/convert-page.mjs (+ README), .gitignore
- Copied all 62 raw images to data/raw/<BOOK>/NNNN.jpg (immutable originals)
- GitHub token configured locally only (never committed)

Stage Summary:
- System skeleton ready; pipeline validated next on M-1 p25/p26 + S-1 p3/p5 before mass conversion
- Binding docs for all agents: docs/CONVENTIONS.md + tools/prompt.txt
